    "#Performance: In a large software project with many print statements, printing to the console can add significant overhead and slow down the program. With logging, you can selectively enable or disable messages based on their severity, which can improve the performance of your program.\n",
    "\n",

By using different logging levels and destinations, you can quickly find the information you need to fix issues and improve the quality of your code.\n",
